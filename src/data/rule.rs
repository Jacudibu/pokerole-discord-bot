Evolution thresholds are Level 3 for second stage, and Level 6 for third stage evolutions. In severe cases where even the second evo has terrible stats, such as for e.g. the Weedle/Kakuna/Beedrill line, you may apply for an exception to be made.
If you want to have your evolution happen under specific circumstances, feel free to hit up any Quest Giver to create an evo-quest for you!

Characters who wish to not evolve upon reaching the required rank might choose to do so as well, and still receive the stats and most of the moves the evolved pokemon would have (not the abilities, though)! Think of it as an upgraded 'plus' version. This also does not lock you out from evolving at a later point!

### Initiative
The round starts when the GM asks you to roll initiative! You do that by rolling one d6 and adding your Dexterity as flat amount on top.

Also, if a player takes too long, they may be moved to the end of the turn order at the GMs discretion.
### Combat
After everyone rolled initiative, the turn order will be posted.

Once it's your turn, you can *optionally* interact with **one** item inside your backpack: this is the time to use a berry or switch your held item! Describe what your character will do and then use `/move` in order to post your action.

Next, roll the move's accuracy.
> **Example**: You are Bronze rank and have a dex of 3. `/move` says the move uses `Dexterity + Rank`, so you may roll 4 dice!

4-6 counts as success here. You need at least one success for the attack to hit. If you roll three 6's, you'll deal critical damage!

If the attack hits, do the same for damage.
> **Example**: You have a strength of 3. Your move damage calls for `Strength + 2`, so you may `/roll` 5 damage dies!

Every success will inflict one damage. STAB and super effectiveness both increase that damage by 1.

If the effects call for additional Chance Dice to cause status effects, roll those now in the order they are mentioned.
