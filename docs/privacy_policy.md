# Privacy Policy

## What data do you collect and what is it used for?

From all the *useless* information we receive through Discord, we only store your Discord ID – a number which identifies
and thus can be traced back to your Discord account – on our servers, plus the IDs to identify Channels and Servers when
from which commands originate when necessary. Any of your further interactions with the bot will then be associated to
these unique identifiers.

When needed, other data sent through your commands will be stored within our database, such as the characters you
create and the *witty* names you give them or their amazing stat-spreads. This is necessary in order to spit out the
data later within those *nicely* formatted character sheets *(surprise!)* or in messy drop-down lists for our poor GMs
whenever they want to reward you for your latest shenanigans. Thus, it might also be visible to other users on the same
server, **so for the love of god, don't enter any private information anywhere**.

In case the commands you send to the bot cause a critical error, their content will be logged within a private
discord channel in order for our authorized *(and underpaid!)* code monkeys to spot, reproduce and fix any bugs as well
as to improve general usability if we notice people using commands wrong over and over. *Of course, you would never do
that, right? ...This also includes the discord id we've mentioned earlier, by the way!* Those error logs are manually
deleted once the respective bug is fixed - usually within two weeks. *(That's just an estimate. This has never happened
before, our application is perfectly bug-free, after all!)*

## How do you protect my data?

All our data is securely stored on a server in Germany. *Nobody here understands what "zeh internetz" really is and how
it works, which makes it an extra secure location.* The data we collect is only used to facilitate the publicly
available commands of the bot *(duh)* and will never be sold *(or given away in any other way)* to third parties. *(The
stuff we store is worthless anyway, so even if we wanted to make money, nobody would buy it!)* Logs and Database
Backups are securely uploaded to a private discord channel, only accessible to our personally authorized code monkeys.

## How can I see what data you have collected on me?

*The easiest way would be to just look at your character sheets.*

But if that's not enough, you have a right to request a terribly formatted dump of all the data we store about you, just
message us on the [support server](https://discord.gg/jVrv2YG2zU) if you *really* want one of those, and you will get
one within a month. ~~But seriously, please don't, I'm highly allergic to extra work.~~

## How long do you store my data?

Indefinitely, unless you delete it. While we would *love* to get rid of your junk and free up some precious disk space,
both servers and users have a legitimate interest that the characters and items on them don't just randomly poof from
the world because a certain someone is taking a vacation. *(That's also why we only store the bare necessities as
outlined earlier. Storage ain't cheap!)*

## How can I delete my data?

You can always revoke your agreement and get both your account and data deleted by joining the [support
server](https://discord.gg/jVrv2YG2zU) and asking for it. **Doing it through discord is the only way for us to verify
that it's really *you* who's asking for it.** *We will then try our best to figure out how the hell one deletes only
specific user data from a database **within a month**. Wait... ChatGPT says I should just drop a table? Okay!*

In all seriousness though, in case you got any questions, issues or concerns, just hop onto the [support
server](https://discord.gg/jVrv2YG2zU) and talk to someone with a shiny yellow name, and we'll see it resolved as soon
as possible.
